Gait: Cruise control (= timed walking sequence) linear cruise x velocity = 0.5
Friction Rings: attached to all feet
BOTA Force Sensors: attached to FR and HR (weight per sensor 120g, 1 leg almost 1kg)
Experiment: Magneto climbs on the blue continuous surface at 90°
Room Temperature: 26-28°C
footfall pattern: FR=AR, FL=AL, HL=BL, HR=BR
Magneto always placed as good as possible to vertical alignment as start position if not stated otherwise

My: -0.3
Mz: -0.1
Run1: 12:06pm
          first foot FR, FL, HL
          failed after 3 steps (error: lost contact of FR foot)
          => not saved
Run2: 12:12pm
          first foot FR, FL, HL, HR
          failed after 4 steps (didn't attach HR)
CHANGE: moved target tip position of all feet from 20 to 25 (cm) -->
        y distance from centre to foot tip -->
        feet parallel aligned to the wall from the beginning
Run3: 12:18pm
          3 complete cycles
CHANGE: order of footfall pattern to FR, HL, FL, HR
Run4: 12:24pm
          HL, FR (=> wrong footfall order)
          failed after two steps (didn't attach FR)
CHANGE: corrected foot order to previous thought to be FR, HL, FL, HR
Run5: 12:30pm
          FR, HR, FL
          failed after 3 steps (didn't attach FL)
Run6: 12:39pm
          failed with FR
HOMED entire robot on "station": FL seems to be not parallel to the wall
The way the gait works is that a forward speed is defined, the red "goal points"
therefore constantly move forward. This means that depending on the order of the footfall
the "reach" for one leg might differ to another one. Currently the red dot shape is
a square. Changing this shape might lead to gaits with less wide stances, although when
making it rectangular Magneto would have to tilt the body to reach the position
(what lizards do with spine bending).
Run7: 12:59pm
          AR=1, BR=3, BL=0, AL=2
          failed after complete cycle at FL (didn't attach)
CHANGE: pose negation phase starts and ends adjusted to new foot order. Likely to have caused FL to stuff up
Run8: 1:04pm (video recorded by Chris, phone)
          FR, HL, HR, FL
          failed after 1 complete cycle and 3 steps: FR detached when FL was about to move
          recorded testing after running (in air and on ground),
          therefore only start of file interesting (big file)

SYSTEMATICALLY VARY DIRECTION OF CLIMBING:
CHANGE: linear cruise x velocity reduced to = 0.25 --> smaller steps
CHANGE: set footfall pattern back to original cycle pattern
Run9: 1:18pm (video recorded by Chris, phone)
          FR, FL
          failed after FL detached, FR lost contact + FR COXA failed

DATA COLLECTION ON HR----------------------------------------------------------
UNBIASED!
linear cruise x velocity = 0.75 (max 1.0)
vertical start direction if not stated otherwise
Run27: 2:57pm (Chris video)
          FR, FL, HL, HR
          failed after failing to make contact with FR, entire robot came off
Run28: 3:03pm
          FR, FL, HL, HR
          failed due to insufficient attachment of FR
CHANGE: step_frequency reconfigured from 0.5 to 0.75, because the points were moving away too fast,
therefore only swing phase time changed before because motors have to cover more distance in less time
not so stance phase time.
Run29: 3:07pm
          FR, FL, HL, HR, FR
          failed due to insufficient attachment of FL
CHANGE: step_frequency reconfigured from 0.75 to 1.0 (max 2.0)

          FR, FL, HL, HR, FR
          failed due to insufficient attachment of FL
          Still reaching, it seems to move target points even faster when increasing step_frequency?
CHANGE: change x velocity back to 0.5, leave frequency at 1.0

-----
SCREENSHOT from velocity 1 and frequency 1 (last step completes just before red point exists foot work area)
x velocity changes how far the red dot is from the foot point (1 being front tip, 0 walking on the spot, -1 being back tip=walking backward)
-----
CHANGE: x velocity -0.5, step_frequency back to original 0.5
Run33: 3:20pm (backward walking ~ head-down climbing)
